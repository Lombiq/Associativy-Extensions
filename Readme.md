# Associativy Extensions Readme



## Project Description

Extensions for the Associativy (http://associativy.com) Orchard graph platform.

**Please do not open issues here! All Associativy issues should be on the [Associativy project site](https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/associativy/).**

See the [Associativy homepage](http://associativy.com/).

## Features

- Projector filters for searching for nodes by label (like through the search box displayed above graphs) and for fetching direct neighbours of nodes.
- AssociativyGraphLinksPart for displaying a "View on graph" link for content items. You can set up which frontend engine to use.
- Token for getting a node's label.
